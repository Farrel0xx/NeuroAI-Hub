# Core web framework for the app
streamlit==1.32.0  # Latest stable version as of 2025, or remove version for newest

# Deep learning framework (use CPU version for lighter size and no GPU issues on Streamlit Cloud)
tensorflow-cpu==2.15.0  # Or latest 2.x; avoids full tensorflow with GPU deps

# Alternative: full tensorflow if you need potential GPU support (but bigger and may have warnings)
# tensorflow==2.15.0

# Image processing (headless version REQUIRED for Streamlit Cloud to avoid libGL errors)
opencv-python-headless==4.9.0.80  # Headless fixes "cannot open shared object file" issue

# For handling images in Streamlit (upload/display)
Pillow==10.2.0  # PIL library

# Numerical computations and array handling
numpy==1.26.4

# Scientific computing (often used for image ops in segmentation)
scipy==1.11.4

# Optional: If your app uses scikit-image for extra processing (common in segmentation)
# scikit-image==0.22.0

# Optional: If you use matplotlib for plots (e.g., show results)
# matplotlib==3.8.2
